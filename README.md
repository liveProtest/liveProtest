# liveProtest

This app will allow to count every participants in a protest, using their GPS location. 
For those who can't partake at the protest, they can support the protest by allowing their tracking at their place (location should not be share for privacy)
It's an open-source app, meaning that everyone can check the code to see what it does with your datas.

I'm looking for developers to manage the pull-request & so on this repo.

## Getting Started

The app use React-native with Type-Script.

### Prerequisites

- NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- GIT: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- VSCode (or other): https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Facultative
- Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/studio

### Installing

In terminal, run:

    npm start

Then choose where you want to deploy the app (web, device or simulator)

## STATUS:
For now the app use the basic demo template of a react-native Type-Script app.
It can get the location of the user by pressing a button "Start Tracking".

## TODOs:
- Find a database service to upload each user location. A decentralized database would be great.
- Make some stats (eg: number of protesters in Paris, number of protesters in France, etc) and made it accessible.
- Show on a map each user
- Assure Android/iOS compatibility
- Deploy on store
